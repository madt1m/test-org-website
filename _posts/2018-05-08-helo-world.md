### [+] deployed

So, here we are. This is the first post, -- hopefully -- the first of many.

Feel free to hang around. There's not much, but much still has to come.

### 0x0804310f -> "What to expect?"

As stated in the timeline, university aside, my main activities right now
are CyberChallenge.it program, and Google Summer of Code 2018. Check more about
this:

[GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

[GSoC proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5438256557064192)

[CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/)

So, mostly, not considering crazy thoughts that could lead to even more crazy
posts, I will be posting weekly updates on GSoC, CTF writeups, some weird hack
which I am trying to land, and so on.

Take a seat, and enjoy. Life is a lifetime chase for knowledge, and sharing.
